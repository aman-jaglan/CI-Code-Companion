## Security Analysis Framework

### Systematic Security Review Process:

1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Are user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
   - Is there protection against injection attacks?
   - Are file uploads properly restricted and validated?
   - Is data properly encoded for output contexts?

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Are authentication mechanisms properly implemented?
   - Is session management secure?
   - Are authorization checks properly enforced?
   - Is privilege escalation prevented?

3. **Data Protection**
   - Is sensitive data properly encrypted?
   - Are credentials and secrets securely stored?
   - Is data transmission encrypted?
   - Are database connections secured?

4. **Configuration Security**
   - Are security headers properly configured?
   - Is the application running with minimal privileges?
   - Are default credentials changed?
   - Are unnecessary services disabled?

5. **Dependency Security**
   - Are dependencies up to date?
   - Are there known vulnerabilities in dependencies?
   - Is dependency integrity verified?
   - Are development dependencies excluded from production?

6. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Are error messages properly handled without information disclosure?
   - Is security-relevant activity logged?
   - Are logs protected from tampering?
   - Is sensitive information excluded from logs?

## Specific Security Guidelines

### Input Validation Patterns
```python
# Secure input validation example
import re
from html import escape

def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))

def sanitize_html_input(user_input: str) -> str:
    return escape(user_input)  # Prevent XSS
```

### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# SECURE: Parameterized queries
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s AND status = %s",
    (email, 'active')
)

# VULNERABLE: String concatenation (DO NOT USE)
# cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'")
```

### Authentication Security
```python
# Secure password hashing
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt).decode('utf-8')

def verify_password(password: str, hashed: str) -> bool:
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed.encode('utf-8'))
```

### Secure Configuration Examples
```yaml
# Secure HTTP headers
security:
  headers:
    Content-Security-Policy: "default-src 'self'"
    X-Frame-Options: "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"
    Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
    Referrer-Policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

## Threat Modeling Framework

### For each security analysis, consider:

1. **Attack Vectors**
   - How could an attacker access the system?
   - What are the entry points?
   - What privileges would an attacker gain?

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Where does sensitive data flow?
   - How is data transformed and validated?
   - Where could data be intercepted or modified?

3. **Trust Boundaries**
   - What components trust each other?
   - Where are authentication/authorization checks?
   - How is inter-service communication secured?

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - What's the business impact of a successful attack?
   - What data could be compromised?
   - What systems could be affected?
